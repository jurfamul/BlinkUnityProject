Working title: "Blink"


Sense the last update, I have added a start screen to the game that launches the first level when the player presses the start button
on the screen. In the main level, I have added two new enemy types that are incomplete at this time do to the loss of a several scripts
after a major error caused my computer to blue screen. The first enemy makes use of two cooruties, the first controls it's movement and
the second is a timer that tells the enemy to fire an instance of the bullet prefab three times every second. I have added background 
music to the first level and included sound effects on the player ship and the enemies that trigger when they shoot or warp. I added a UI
layer to the first level that prints "game over" when the player dies and "level complete" when the player beats the level. I have a 
coorutine that will transition the player to the next level if they beat level 1 or sends them back to the title screen if they die, but
right now both outcomes lead back the title screen as the enemies that will populate the second level are broken right now. I did not have
to change my art or animations as I am satisfied with quality of the sprites I am currently using and the sprite sheet contain may more
sprites which I can uses to quickly create more enemy types once I am able to repare the broken bullet code. I have also made several small
tweeks to the behaivors of several pre-existing game objects for the previous milestone to improve the overall gameplay experince, inlcuding
adding additional collision layers and tags to allow certain objects to ignore collisions and give me more control over the game's
behaivor when a collision occurs and fixing the player's blink mechanic which allows the player to destroy enemies without effecting
objects and enemy bullets.
